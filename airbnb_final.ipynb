    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is an online peer-to-peer property rental service that allows users to book short-term lodging. This includes rooms, apartments, entire homes, vacation rentals, etc. Airbnb brokers reservations between users and landlords for lodging all over the world. As of January 2018, the company had over 3 million listings in 65,000 cities over 191 countries ( [reference](https://www.airbnb.com/about/about-us) ). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to immediately pique a new user's interest is to advertise bookings in a city or country the user would first like to visit. By accurately predicting where a new user will book his or her first trip, Airbnb can curate personalized content to showcase that will result in the user completing their booking. For Airbnb, this helps decrease the average time for first booking for a new user and helps personalize content for their community. It also improves the new user's first booking experience by curating content to their travel preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb has done a fair amount of research on this topic, including initiating a [Kaggle Recruitment Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings#description) to address this very issue. Many of the contestants shared their views on their approach to solving the first booking problem and their findings during implementation (see [Pons](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/03/07/airbnb-new-user-bookings-winners-interview-3rd-place-sandro-vega-pons/] ) and [Kuroyanagi](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/03/17/airbnb-new-user-bookings-winners-interview-2nd-place-keiichi-kuroyanagi-keiku/) ). \n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge then becomes: How can Airbnb predict the country in which a new user will make his or her first booking?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will predict a new user's first booking by deploying machine learning algorithms to analyze data about the user that will help predict this first booking. Airbnb has posted this very problem as a [Kaggle Recruitment Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings#description) and has provided New User Booking Data to help participants develop models to predict a new user's first booking. This data includes information about users demographics, web session records, and summary statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to analyze the data, build and train a model, and test this model to predict a new user's first booking."

    "## Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that features in training dataset can be leveraged to come up with a model that can accurately predict where a new user's first destination will be. We understand that information about past users, including their actions, characteristics, demographics, and personal information, can be used to develop a machine learning model to predict where a new user with similar traits would decide to travel. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with the 15 features included in the `training_set` as the inputs for the model, and the `country_destination` feature as the label. Along the way, we may find some features less useful than others, while some features combined may help simplify our model. These will be explored more as we test our model's capabilities and determine the pros and cons of using different models.We will be sure to test out a variety of supervised-learning models, including SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. We will use ensemble learning techniques such as Gradient Tree Boosting and XGBoost as our final solution and will prove finalize how boosting will yield a better result than standard supervised learning algorithms. We will also do parameter tuning using Gridsearch."

    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle assesses submissions based on Normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG). Discounted cumulative gain is used to measure ranking quality, usually for measuring the effectiveness of web search engine algorithms. The *gain* measured can be thought of as the usefulness of an element based on its position in the list of results, where results are a list of elements in graded relevance scale generated from search-engine. This gain is accumulated from the top of the list to the bottom, with the gain of each result discounted at lower ranks (ref [Discounted cumulative gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#Normalized_DCG)). Since the list of results can vary in length, the cumulative gain at each position should be **normalized** across queries to achieve consistencey. This can be calculated using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://image.ibb.co/bBNhYb/NDCG1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "where reli is the relevance of the result at position i. We will be making a maximum of 5 predictions per booking (k = 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "For each new user, we make a maximum of 5 predictions on the country of the first booking. The ground truth country is marked with relevance = 1, while the rest have relevance = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for example, the destination for a particular user is France (FR), then the predictions become:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://image.ibb.co/dc1btb/Capture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle uses nDCG as the [evaluation metric](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings#evaluation) to assess participants for their competition, so this will be our metric as well. The reasoning behind this is that nDCG is designed for situations of graded notions of relevance, which is ideal for our project. Using **precision** or **recall** are generally good metrics to evaluate the level of relevance importance. However, neither of these meterics considers the *position* of an item in the retrieved result list. Rather than using a binary relevance function, we need to evaluate our list using a graded relevance function to measure the gain of an element based on its position in the result list. Since we will be evaluating our top 5 predictions per booking, we need to evaluate the *ranking quality* of our model, which the gain will help us measure. "

    "Ensemble learning is a powerful way to improve Machine Learning models. It involves combining invidiual learners, which are considered \"weak\" learners, to create a \"strong learner\". The weak learners can be a number of machine learning models, such as SVMs or Naive Bayes Classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use two ensemble learners that use Decision Trees as their \"weak learners\" and will use a Decision Tree as our benchmark model\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the Ensemble Learners we will be building to make our predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Learners\n",
    "    1. Random Forest Classifier: In Random Forest models, a random percentage of the data is chosen T times, where T is the number of Decision Trees. After the data passes through the trees, the result is either averaged as a mean prediction (regression) or as a class (classification). The advantage of Random Forests is that they operate with the bias of a single decision tree but decrease the variance, so they make up for the overfitting you would get with a decision tree. \n",
    "    2. XGBoost: XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that utilizes gradient boosting with decision trees. Boosting is an ensemble technique where new models are added to correct errors made by existing models. In this case, the models are decision trees. Trees are added sequentiall until no further imrpovements can be made. XGBoost has high execution speed, strong model performance, and is the go-to algorithm for winners of Kaggle competitions\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Additional Supervised Learners\n",
    "Although we will be using Decision Trees as our benchmark, we will also try to make predictions using a couple of other Machine Learning Algorithms to give us perspective. Here are a couple of basic supervised learners we will also be training:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression can be used to fit complex, non-linear datasets. It uses gradient descent to find the coeficients of the polynomial to best split the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Support Vector Machine: SVM can be considered as one of the basic Machine Learning algorithms for supervised learning and is good to use when there is a clear margin of separation for the data. However, it is not recommended when dealing with a large data set because training time takes a while (training time is cubic in the size of the data set)."

They are able to learn simple decision rules when being trained on training data. They are, however, prone to overfitting when dealing with data that has lots of features. They are better suited as building blocks for ensemble methods, which we will see later. Since our goal is to build ensemble learner classifiers that are built using decision trees, it is only right that we use a decision tree as our baseline score."

As we can see from the confusion matrix, the SVM does a poor job of predicting all the destinations, with an accuracy of 0.49. We can see that the decision boundaries are not linear and the Linear SVM is not the appropriate model to use for our case. We can, instead, try to use a logistic classifier, which does a better job with non-linear datasets."

    "Since XGBoost is not from the sklearn library, it had to be built from a third party git repository (instructions can be found [here](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)). We ran into trouble while trying to build and import the XGBoost library on our Windows machine and were unable to take advantage of our i7 processor. Installing and building this library was much easier on a Linux computer, so we instead ran our implementation on a machine with less computing power, which ended up taking longer.\n",

    "We expected better results for the SVC and were dissapointed with its inability to make good predictions on our data, getting < 50% accuracy. We did know that SVC's drawback is that it does not work well with large amounts of data and large amounts of feature, but we assumed that by reducing the features we'd expect decent results. Luckily we also trained a Logistic Regression Classifier, which was able to provide us with some perspective to compare results with our benchmark Decision Tree and our Ensemble Learners. Linear SVMs and logistic regression generally perform similarly in practice. The poor performance of our Linear SVM may also have been because the data is not linearly separable. However, we did get good results from our Logistic Regression Classifier, so we did not revisit the SVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training time for SVC (~ 10 minutes) and XGBoost (~ 36 minutes) were much longer than the other models. We will compare the exact runtimes later in the **Results** section, but it was inconvenient to wait so long for results, especially in the case of XGBoost, which had parameters we were tuning. We ran multiple training rounds with XGBoost with different values for the max_depth and learning_rate, each time tweaking one or the other and seeing the different results. We noticed that more max_depth resulted in better accuracies each time. Rather than continuing with this trial and error process, we instead decided to use `GridSearchCV` to help us optimize through a selection of parameters. This process is described in the **Refinement**."

    "Our ensemble learners were cleary out performing our basic models, but we decided to implement **GridSearch** to see if we could improve our models even more. Grid search is a hyperparameter optimization technique for models that exhaustively considers all parameter combinations. The advantage of using GridSearch is that rather than figuring out the best hyperparameters by trial and error, or simply using the default values for these parameters, we can fit our GridSearch model with our classifier and the GridSearchCV will find us the best estimator. `GridSearchCV` chooses the best estimator based on the best cross-validation score.\n",

It first divides the dataset randomly into k different batches. Then, it chooses one of these batches as the validation batch and the others to train the model. It then uses the batch that was held out for testing, which gives us one estimate of the models' error. This process is repeated k times, where each time a different batch is held out as the testing batch."

    "As we had predicted, the ensemble learners performed better than the basic supervised learners. Surprisingly, the XGBoost with optimized parameters actually performed worse than without optimized parameters on the public score, even though our local accuracy and nDCG scores showed that it performed better. This may have been because we had not provided it with the default value for the learning rate as one of the options for the parameters. Regardless, the difference between the two is minimal, as is the difference between the Random Forest classifier and the Random Forest classifier with optimized parameters. We will elaborate more on this later."

Seeing these results, one might think that using GridSearchCV to optimize the results might not be worth the trouble for our ensemble learners. The improvement in accuracy and nDCG is minimal, but the runtime difference is highly signifficant (28x for Random Forest, 76x for XGBoost). Truthfully this decision relies on the user and the use case. In the case where the testcase involves medical data and people's lives, every fraction of a percentage counts. However, in the case where we are looking to advertise for a user to book a trip somewhere, the extra runtime for such a small improvement is not necessary."

    "In both cases where we used `GridSearchCV`, our accuracy and nDCG values went up for the respective classifiers. When we look at the best parameters, we see that GridSearch chose the highest max depth for both our Random Forest and our XGBoost classifiers from the choices we had provided. This means that of all of the simulations, the model with the maximum number of trees from the parameters provided was needed to provide the best score. In other words, we needed the highest level of complexety in terms of depth of model to get the best score. This may be because of the number of features we are working with is on the larger side, so we need a more complex model to give us better results. GridSearch also chose the lowest learning rate (0.12) from the values provided. This means that the model is a better learner when it takes smaller steps to learn. Again, given our large number of features, the model may miss something when it takes large steps during gradient descent and when it takes smaller steps, it is able to fit more closely to the data."

    "In both cases, age seems to be the highest level of importance when looking at our features to determine where a user will first book his or her first trip. This makes sense, as certain destinations are more catered to a young crowd who might be looking for a livelier nightlife and more outdoor adventures, while an older user may be looking at destinations with more relaxing environments or family friendly activities. We seen that the week # of the year (dac_wn) that an account is created is also in the top 5 features. This would also make sense, considering the time a user creates his/her account could be because they are looking to take a trip to go somewhere with better weather conditions than they are currently in. For example, a user who lives in New York may get fed up with the cold weather in December and want to book a trip to South America. Also, U.S. users tend to have longer vacation time during Christmas time and during the summer time between June-August. As Europe is a close and popular destination for U.S. citizens, a user who makes his/her account in May, for example, might be doing so with the intentions of finding lodging for his/her Europe trip that is coming up in the next month or two"

    "Although we have grown through the use of the classic supervised learning models, we are seeing more and more the benefits of using ensemble learning algorithms to provide better prediction results for data analysis. With this project, we demonstrated that ensemble learning classifiers such as Random Forest and XGBoost are able to provide better results than simply using weak learners. Using a model such as a decision tree or SVM can still provide good results, however leveraging these supervised learners to build stronger ensemble learners helps use their strengths without suffering from the setbacks of overfitting or inefficiency on larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we could extend our work to potentially utilize the rest of the available data, such as the age and countries data sets, to possibly encorporate more user data. Additionally, we might consider using different boosting algorithms, such as Adaboost, or neural networks to see if we can create even better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest takeaway from this project was learning the power of Gridsearch. We were able to see significant imporvements in our Random Forest and XGBoost models after using Gridsearch to optimize our learning parameters. Although runtime ends up being longer, it is still better in the long run to come away with the best parameters, rather than tuning all parameters one at a time on your own until you find the best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our final results, as well as the final results of future participants, would be greatly improved with some preliminary improvements to the available data. The sessions training data, for example, was missing almost half of the users information. Furthermore, the data could be improved by adding a specific state for the users who live in the United States. It is understandable that in Airbnb's initial years, most users were in the U.S., yet this skewed the data so heavily to \"user lives in the U.S.\" that it was difficult to use any more information on their location. For example, there are some cities that have large populations of immigrants from different areas in the world. If we had these cities available to us in the data, we would be able to make better predictions on whether or not the user may be planning a trip back home to see their family and where that may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project was a great lesson in both data manipulation and the benefits of different Machine Learning algorithms. We visualized our data, identified key features that stood out, cleaned out others that were not relevant, and trained and refined models to give us our best chance at predicting future users' first bookings.
